I built an intelligent chatbot designed to translate natural language into SQL queries, using open-source large language models (LLMs) and advanced prompt engineering techniques. By integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), the chatbot could clarify user inputs and offer adaptive responses, enabling seamless interaction with complex databases. Leveraging the Cortex API, I enhanced the chatbot's precision by 40%, ensuring it provided contextually accurate, data-driven answers. This innovation improved internal data accessibility, empowering users to make informed decisions efficiently. Additionally, I deployed these advancements through intuitive web applications with Streamlit and React, optimizing user experience and workflow productivity"

My work centers on analyzing language data to understand the relationship between emotional word norms and their usage in text. I develop scripts that examine how emotional characteristics of words relate to their log frequency and position within a corpus. As part of this project, I design and implement regression models that correlate emotional norms with linguistic features. This analysis helps uncover how emotionally charged language influences memory and decision-making processes, offering insights into the cognitive mechanisms behind emotional interpretation in language.
